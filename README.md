# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice
Custom implementations of data structures from "Data Structures for Game Programmers" by Ron Penton.

## Overview
Learning project where I implemented fundamental data structures from scratch to understand memory management and optimization for game development.

## Implemented Structures
- **Dynamic Arrays**: Template-based resizable arrays with manual memory management
- **Bitvectors**: Efficient bit manipulation for flags and boolean arrays
- **Linked Lists**: Single linked list implementation
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: Bidirectional traversal support

## Currently Studying
- **Hash Tables**: Paused here to implement learned structures in real projects first

## Example Code
Monster management system demonstrating:
- Dynamic array growth strategies
- Efficient removal using swap-and-pop
- Practical game development patterns

## Learning Approach
Rather than rushing through the entire book, I stopped at hash tables to:
- Implement these structures in actual projects
- Understand performance implications in real scenarios
- Solidify knowledge through practical application

## Application
These custom implementations helped me understand the internals before using STL containers in my game engines. Knowing how data structures work at the memory level was crucial for:
- Optimizing my ECS sparse sets
- Understanding cache performance
- Making informed decisions about container choices

## Note
Temporarily using STL in my 2D engine while focusing on features, but this foundational knowledge guides all my architectural decisions.
